CP-317-C Project at Wilfrid Laurier University

This project will process two text files, where one of the files contains the students names, and the other with the course along with the test scores, and then output to a new file summarizing the students performance. This software contains two input files, “CourseFiles.txt” and “NameFile.txt”. CourseFile includes Student ID, Course codes, Test scores, and Exam scores. NameFile includes the student ID and student name. This software will calculate the student's final grade in their course by using the formula:
**Final Grade = Test 1 x 20% + Test 2 x 20% + Test 3 x 20% + Final Exam x 40%**

Then, formatted and output results into a new file, which is sorted by student ID.

This project is completed by a group of two students in CP-317-C and serves as a tool to help develop group 20’s skills in object-oriented design principles, offensive programming, communication and collaboration skills.
